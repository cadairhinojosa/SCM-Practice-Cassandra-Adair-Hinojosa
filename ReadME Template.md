What is SCM?
====
As software is being developed there is always room for improvement. Which means there can and will be changes that need to be implemented and updated to the current software to improve it. As well as if requirements change or features need to be changed, then we should be able to update those changes and make records of them. That way we can keep track of everything prior to the change being implemented and after the change has been implemented. This is why System Configuration Management (SCM) comes into play, this is a process that allows us to track and control changes to the software. It allows us to ensure we are managing each change or version throughout the development process.

An example of this would be utilizing GitHub as a tool for configuration management. It allows us to put in pull requests which we can propose changes that we want to implement, and the team can review them before we merge it with the code. It also allows us to track not only those requests, but also any bugs that might come about because of an implementation and any changes or tasks that need to be done. It also allows us to merge with changes to different branches of our code and we have the option to merge, choose which branch we want to merge it to, and keep a record of every change that has been made to the code.
