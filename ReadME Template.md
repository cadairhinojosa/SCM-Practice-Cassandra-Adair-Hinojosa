What is SCM?
====
As software is being developed there is always room for improvement. Which means there can and will be changes that need to be implemented and updated to the current software to improve it. As well as if requirements change or features need to be changed, then we should be able to update those changes and make records of them. That way we can keep track of everything prior to the change being implemented and after the change has been implemented. This is why System Configuration Management (SCM) comes into play, this is a process that allows us to track and control changes to the software. It allows us to ensure we are managing each change or version throughout the development process.
